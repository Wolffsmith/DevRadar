# DevRadar

DevRadar is a complete app to register and search Devs near you.

This is the mobile installation.

## Installation

##### Use the package manager of your preference. I've used yarn, so the examples will be with yarn.

##### This project uses Expo, so you will have to have a phone with Expo installed.

### Dependencies

To install the dependencies just open the backend folder within a command line and type:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Usage

Again on your command line type:

yarn start
